# Fork this repo
This is for creating a pull request management tool with nodejs. 
Big thanks for participating!!

## Four Parts

1. Quick introduction to node - we'll create a new project and then install it in another project, we'll see how to create a binary with npm and also touch on the anatomy of package.json

2. We'll start our project (this repo) for prchief, (pull request chief) You'll see how to connect via http/https using request from node using the http/s module. I'll show how to make one then we'll refactor in our own time

3. We'll forward to a more refactored version of prhcief, with its githubapi and code structure more organized.
